## üíª Overview

The CF Partners CRUD test is a web project that consists of a user application used to create, read, update, and delete user information for managing user details and credentials within an application. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a fundamental approach in software development, and its effective implementation is essential for the functionality and usability of many information systems. 

The CF Partners test demonstrates the practical application of these principles in a specific context, emphasizing the importance of robust and efficient user management.

Next.js is a popular React framework for building web applications. It is designed to make it easy to create server-rendered React applications and provides features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and routing out of the box.
